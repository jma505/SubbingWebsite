<b>Help for &quot;My Schedule (current and previous)&quot;</b><p>
This screen shows your current 13-month or previous 12-month schedule, depending on which menu item
you have chosen.  The following columns of information appear on this page:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Month</b> - This is the month and year for which Saturdays and/or Sundays display.  (The display of Saturdays
and Sundays is controlled by choices on the &quot;View/Edit My Info&quot; page.)</li><br>
<li><b>Date</b> - This will have the Saturday and/or Sunday dates for each month.  Clicking on the Date will take you
to a page where you can create or update your schedule for this date.  <b>NOTE:</b> Saturdays are in BLUE, Sundays
are in BLACK, and Church Holidays are in RED.</li><br>
<li><b>Pieces?</b> - If there is a musical note (<img src="images/8thnote.gif"/>)
in this column, then you have entered something in the &quot;Pieces Played&quot; field for this date's
schedule.  You are strongly encouraged to fill in that field, as it contributes to a lot of the value-added of this site.  If the 
musical note is present, hovering on it will show what you have entered.</li><br>
<li><b>Location</b> - The church where you are scheduled to play.  Clicking on it will display all of the past dates you
have played at this location <u>for which you have entered Pieces Played</u>.</li><br>
<li><b>Tentative?</b> - If there is a star (<img src="images/star2.gif"/>) in this column, you have marked this
schedule as Tentative.  Your name will show up in parentheses on the list of available organists for this date, 
indicating that you might be available.  One particularly good use of Tentative is scheduling possible vacation dates
by choosing the &quot;UNAVAILABLE&quot; location.  It can also be used to tentatively reserve a playing commitment,
in which case the star reminds you that you may not have received confirmation for that date's schedule.</li><br>
<li><b>Delete</b> - A trashcan (<img src="images/x.gif"/>) appears in this column for every scheduled date.  Clicking on
it will delete this date's schedule.  Once you click on this, you cannot recover that date's information; you will have to
create a new schedule for that date.</li><br>
<li><b>Church Holiday Name</b> - For any Church Holiday (dates in RED), the name of that holiday will show up in
small print at the end of the line.  This will help to eliminate confusion when a Church Holiday occurs on a Saturday
or Sunday (e.g. December 2006 - Christmas Eve is on a Sunday, so both the Sunday and the Holiday show up on the
schedule).</li><br>
</ul>
