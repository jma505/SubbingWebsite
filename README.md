SubbingWebsite
==============
This is a website which manages calendaring for substitute organists and has both public and private areas. Churches can
view the public calendar and see who might be available on any given day. Members (substitutes) update their schedules
in the private area and can optionally track what music they have played as well as access/maintain both public and
private notes relating to each venue and service. The backend database is PostgreSQL.
