<b>Welcome to the Pioneer Valley Substitute Organists Application!</b><br>
<br>
This application allows substitute organists to maintain their schedules online, and you reap the benefit of being 
able to check the availability of several potential substitutes at once.  The substitutes choose whether they want to
be available on Saturdays only, Sundays only, or both (more on that later).<p>
While every effort is being made to make this website display correctly in Internet Explorer, it looks much
better in any other browser (we recommend Firefox).  IE will randomly screw up page displays, particularly
in the Member's portion of the site.<p>
Each page has a set of tabs on the top.  Selecting one of the tabs will take you to that part of the site.<p>
<b>Calendar Tab (the Main View)</b><p>
Saturdays, Sundays, and Church Holidays are listed for a twelve-month period.  At a quick glance, you can see whether a sub
might be available by the style and color of the date:  larger, bold, italics Green (Saturdays & Sundays) or
Purple (Church Holiday) is good; smaller and Red is bad.<p>
Hovering on a Green or Purple date will cause a list of the available subs to appear.  In addition, hovering on
a Purple date will also tell you which Church Holiday this is, just to remove any confusion!  If any of
the names are in parentheses, that means that the organist has indicated that they have a tentative commitment on that
date.  In other words, they probably aren't available, but it might be worth asking anyway.<p>
In fact, availability is never guaranteed!  There's nobody forcing the subs to keep their schedules up to date, so even if
they show up as available they may be unavailable when you call them.  If that happens, you might try a gentle reminder to
update their schedule ...<p>
<b>Service Organists Tab</b><p>
<i><b>Note:</b> This information is the same as for the <b>Wedding/Funeral Organists</b> tab, except that this tab lists
all organists rather than just those available for Weddings and Funerals.</i><p>
Here is where you will match the names from the Green dates on the Schedules Page to real people.  The organist entries are presented 
alphabetically by their short names, and there is no implication of any ordering other than that.<p>
For each organist, you will see some if not all of the following information that they have provided:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Full Name</b></li>
<li><b>Availability</b> - Whether they are available Saturdays only, Sundays only, or both</li>
<li><b>Wedding/Funeral Availability</b> - Organists who are available for Weddings and/or Funerals will list details here.</li>
<li><b>Telephone</b> - One or more phone numbers where they can be reached, which also have a description such as &quot;Home,&quot;
&quot;Work,&quot; etc.</li>
<li><b>Email</b> - One or more email addresses, one of which may be marked &quot;Preferred.&quot;  (If there is a Preferred address, please
try it first!)  Clicking on an email address will open up a new message in your mail client, unless your browser does not know how to do that.</li>
<li><b>Travel Area</b> - The substitute may indicate how far they're willing to travel to play for services.</li>
<li><b>Information</b> - Whatever else the substitute would like you to know (experience, preferences, dog's name, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Fees Tab</b><p>
Suggested fees for substitutes, as provided by the national office of the American Guild of Organists, can
be found here.<p>
<b>Checklist Tab</b><p>
This page contains a checklist of suggested discussion items, as well as some things which can be very
helpful to a substitute coming into an unfamiliar situation.<p>
<b>News Tab</b><p>
This menu item will always include the date of the most recent News update.  The News Page pops up in a separate window
the same as this Help Page did.<p>
<b>Contact the Webmaster</b><p>
Click on this link to open a new email message to the WebMaster, John Anderson.  Offer suggestions, helpful comments,
or request a login so that you can be listed as a substitute, too.<p>
<b>Login Tab</b><p>
This link is for substitute organists who have a login to this site.<p>
