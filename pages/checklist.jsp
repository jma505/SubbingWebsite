<h3>Checklist for Churches hiring a Substitute</h3>
<p>This list is provided primarily as an aid to churches hiring a substitute, but may prove useful
to substitutes as well.  If any additional items come to mind, please send them to the Webmaster.</p>
<h4>General Information</h4>
<ul>
<li>Time of service(s), rehearsal, choir warmup</li>
<li>What time is the church open and the organ available for rehearsal on the day of the service?</li>
<li>Are any other organ rehearsal times available or desired?</li>
<li>Location of the console key</li>
<li>Unusual location or quirks of switches</li>
<li>What are the conditions (tuning, general usability) of the organ and piano?</li>
<li>What about parking? Door to enter? Directions? etc.</li>
<li>Who should we look for when we arrive who can answer any additional questions?</li>
<li>In case of emergency that day (car trouble, illness, etc.), who do we contact?  (name and cellphone number)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Organ Music</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is expected (prelude, postlude, offertory, etc.)?</li>
<li>Suggested lengths if appropriate (e.g. &quot;offertory should be 2-3 minutes long&quot;)</li>
<li>What time should the prelude start and end?</li>
<li>Are there preset pistons for hymns?</li>
<li>Are there pistons which the substitute can set if desired? (perhaps a memory level for substitute use?)</li>
<li>Is there a particular musical style that is preferred, or that should be avoided?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Service Details</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't assume we know how your denomination/congregation/leader does things!</li>
<li>Even if we've played for you before, we might not remember the details (we play lots of places!)</li>
<li>Are hymns and other service music announced?</li>
<li>What hymnal is used?</li>
<li>Should we play an Amen at the end of hymns? Always? Only if written? Only if doxology?</li>
<li>Who will be leading the service that day?</li>
<li>When should we expect to receive hymns and other service information?</li>
<li>When you send hymn numbers, please include the tune name and the key</li>
<li>What are the cues for playing each piece of service music?</li>
<li>Is there an Order of Service (bulletin or book), and are there exceptions to it?</li>
<li>What would <b>you</b> want to know if you were playing here for the <b>first time</b>?</li>
<li>Consider creating a &quot;Notes for the Substitute&quot; sheet and keeping it on the console -- it will save
you time when preparing for a sub, and will make life easier should a last-minute sub be required due to illness</li>
</ul>
<h4>Payment</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the pay?</li>
<li>Who will have the check?</li>
<li>Please don't make us hang around after the service looking for someone to pay us --- it's easiest
if the check is on the console when we arrive, or if we're paid before the service starts</li>
<li><i><b>Unless arrangements are made in advance, we expect to be paid when we play, not days or weeks later</b></i></li>
</ul>
