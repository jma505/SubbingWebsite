<b>Welcome to the Pioneer Valley Substitute Organists Website!</b><br>
<br>
This website allows substitute organists to maintain their schedules online, and you, the representative of a church, reap the benefit of being 
able to check the availability of several potential substitutes at once.  The substitutes choose whether they want to
be available on Saturdays only, Sundays only, or both (more on that later).<p>
While every effort is made to make this website browser-friendly, it will sometimes fail to display properly. 
Should that happen to you, please try refreshing the page or using a different browser (<a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> works well).<p>
The username and password fields at the top of the screen are for use by substitute organists when they log into the site
to update their schedules and information.  Unless you are a substitute, you do not need a login to make use of this site.<p>
Each page has several tabs across the top.  Selecting one of the tabs will take you to that part of the site.<p>
<b>Calendar Tab (the Main View)</b><p>
Saturdays, Sundays, and Church Holidays are listed for a twelve-month period.  At a quick glance, you can see whether a sub
might be available by the style and color of the date:  larger, bold, italics Green (Saturdays & Sundays) or
Purple (Church Holiday) is good; smaller and Red is bad.<p>
Hovering on a Green or Purple date will cause a list of the available subs to appear.  In addition, hovering on
a Purple date will tell you which Church Holiday this is, just to remove any confusion!  If any of
the names are in parentheses, that means that the organist has indicated that they have a tentative commitment on that
date.  In other words, they probably aren't available, but it might be worth asking anyway.<p>
In fact, availability is never guaranteed!  There's nobody forcing the subs to keep their schedules up to date, so even if
they show up as available they may be unavailable when you call them.  If that happens, you might try a gentle reminder to
update their schedule ...<p>
<b>Organists Information Tab</b><p>
Here is where you will match the names from the Green dates on the Schedules Page to real people.  The organist entries are presented 
alphabetically by their short names, and there is no implication of any ordering other than that.<p>
For each organist, you will see some or all of the following information depending on what they have provided:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Full Name</b></li>
<li><b>Availability</b> - Whether they are available Saturdays only, Sundays only, or both</li>
<li><b>Wedding/Funeral Availability</b> - Organists who are available for Weddings and/or Funerals will list details here.</li>
<li><b>Telephone</b> - One or more phone numbers where they can be reached, which also have a description such as &quot;Home,&quot;
&quot;Work,&quot; etc.</li>
<li><b>Email</b> - One or more email addresses, one of which may be marked &quot;Preferred.&quot;  (If there is a Preferred address, please
try it first!)  Clicking on an email address will open up a new message in your mail client, unless your browser does not know how to do that.</li>
<li><b>Travel Area</b> - The substitute may indicate how far they're willing to travel to play for services.</li>
<li><b>Information</b> - Whatever else the substitute would like you to know (experience, preferences, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Fees Tab</b><p>
Suggested fee ranges for substitutes, as provided by the national office of the American Guild of Organists, can
be found here.<p>
<b>Checklist Tab</b><p>
This page contains a checklist of suggested discussion items, as well as some things which can be very
helpful to a substitute coming into an unfamiliar situation.<p>
<b>News Tab</b><p>
The tab name will always include the date of the most recent News update.<p>
