<li><b>Short Name</b> - This is your &quot;nickname&quot; on this site.  In the public schedule view, your Short Name
will show on dates where you are available, and your Short Name is what is used to identify your entry on the
Organists lists.  No two substitutes can share the same Short Name.</li><br>
<li><b>Full Name</b> - Typically, this is your first name and last name.  It appears only on the Organists lists to fully
identify you to the public.</li><br>
<li><b>Travel Area</b> - (Optional) If this field has anything entered in it, it will appear in your entry in the
Organists lists.  You can put anything you want in this field, but it is intended to give the public an idea of how far you
are willing to travel for sub jobs.</li><br>
<li><b>Info</b> - (Optional) If this field has anything entered in it, it will appear in your entry in the Organists lists. 
You can put anything you want in this field that will provide information about you to the public.  You may, for example,
wish to use this field to specify what types of churches you are most comfortable with.</li><br>

used only to describe your availability for Weddings and Funerals.  <b>Note:</b> If you only are available for

and &quot;Available Sundays&quot; and put information into this field.</li><br>
