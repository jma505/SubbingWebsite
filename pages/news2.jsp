<b>12/28/2012 - Schedule Update Multiples changes</b>

<ul>
<li>Any existing data in the Pieces Played field for any of the dates being updated will no longer be deleted
when updating multiple dates.</li>

<b>9/16/2012 - Today&#39;s Update</b>
<br />
<ul>
<li>We&#39;re live! The test site, substituteorganists.com, has been shut down until we need it again.</li>

</p>
<p>
<b>9/11/2012 - Today&#39;s Update</b>
<br />
<ul>
<li>RC3 is available!!  This time, I really do think I have resolved the issue that caused the &quot;dojo.byId()&quot;
error messages.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>9/10/2012 - Today&#39;s Update</b>
<br />
<ul>
<li>RC2 (Release Candidate 2) is available!  Barring unforeseen problems, this will be the version that goes live
on Sunday.  I <i>think</i> I have resolved the issue that was causing the &quot;dojo.byId()&quot; pop-up errors, so
if any of you see one of these again please send me an email and be sure to include the browser version that you
are using.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>9/9/2012 - Today&#39;s Update</b>
<br />
<ul>
<li>If you see any pop-up messages relating to &quot;dojo.byId()&quot; or similarly-named functions, you can ignore them
and you should be able to continue working normally.  This is related to a bug which has so far eluded capture.  If you find
that the site is not working after seeing those messages, you should log off and log back in.  In some cases, you may need
to close all browser windows and try again; if that happens, please email the Webmaster.</li>
<li><b>New Feature:</b> Clicking on a Tentative icon on the Current Schedule tab will toggle that setting off, saving the
need to open up the date dialog.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>9/2/2012 - Today&#39;s Update</b>
<br />
<ul>
<li>RC1 (Release Candidate 1) is now available for use.  The banner heading will continue to read &quot;Test&quot; and
a Release Candidate number until this becomes the production version.  Please visit often and try as much of the site as you
can; you can tell from the RC number if anything substantial has changed.  &quot;Email the Webmaster&quot; if you find any issues.</li>
<li><b>The database was copied from production at 7:45am, Sunday, September 2.</b>  Any changes you make here will stay on
this site and will NOT be reflected in the production site.  Any changes you make here will also be overwritten by production
data on the next database refresh.  You can play around as much as you like.</li>
<li>I&#39;ll update this News tab as problems are addressed and other changes made so that you will know what is different.  
These updates may be more frequent than changes to the RC number, depending on the types of changes made.  Minor tweaks
to the look and feel will be noted here; changes that correct functional issues will also cause an RC number change.</li>
</ul>
