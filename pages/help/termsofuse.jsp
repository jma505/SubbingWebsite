<p>
<b>Terms of Use for the website</b><p>
<p>This is a privately developed and run site, neither sponsored nor supported by the AGO.  It exists to serve the
needs of local substitute organists and to be a valuable resource for area churches in need of 
substitutes.</p>
<p>In order to provide maximum value for churches, Contact information must be current. And if your availability is shown in
the public Calendar (&quot;Show in Calendar&quot; is checked on your profile), you are expected to keep your own calendar reasonably
up to date.  The less accurate the availability information is in the public Calendar, the less useful this site will be
perceived to be and the less traffic it will get.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the system will apply the following actions to any user account which has not logged in for a period of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your availability is visible in the public Calendar, failure to log in for <b>3 Months</b> will result in your name 
being removed from the calendar listing (&quot;Show in Calendar&quot; will be unchecked). Your contact information will still be
available in the list of organists, and you can still log in to update your schedule and put yourself back into the calendar.</li>
<li>Failure to log in for <b>6 Months</b> will result in your account being deactivated, and you will appear in neither the
calendar availability listing nor the list of organists.  You will have to contact the webmaster to have your account reactivated.</li>
<li>Failure to log in for <b>1 Year</b> will result in your account and all your information being deleted from the system.</li>
</ul>
