<b>Help for &quot;View/Edit Locations&quot;</b><br>
<br>
<p>From this screen, you can view information about locations as well as add new ones.</p>
<p>The left column lists all the current locations, sorted by state, city, and name.
If you hover your mouse cursor on a location name, you will see at least the first part
of any <b>public notes</b> for that location.</p>
<p>Clicking on a location from the left column will load that location's information into
the form in the right column, where you can view and/or update all the information pertaining
to that location.  <b>Public notes</b> are visible to all substitutes registered to the site,
and should be used for information which may be of interest to anybody playing at this
location.  <b>Private notes</b> are visible <b>only to you,</b> and can be used for anything
without concern that anyone else will see what you have written.  One possible use would be
to store the driving time from your house to that location.</p>
<p>Not all locations have full address information, but <b>any that have the street address
line filled in</b> can be mapped by clicking on the <font color="red"><i>Map Me!</i>
</font> link.  If the street address can't be resolved, you'll see an error on the
map that comes up, so it would be 
great to fill in that address if you know it!</p>
<p>Some locations will not map correctly with just the street address and the city/state;
these must have the ZIP filled in as well.  Please add the ZIP along with the street
address when adding new locations so that the mapping will be sure to show the correct
location!</p>
<p>Adding a new location from this screen is as simple as filling in the information in the
right column and clicking the button to Add/Update.  <b>WARNING:</b> do not do this unless 
the right column boxes are <b>ALL EMPTY!</b>  Failure to observe this warning will result
in changing a location's name and city/state!</p>
